            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to explore the intersectionality of how race and class
                affects LGBTQ+ and gender-nonconforming people within their workplace. Focusing on the
                hiring rates, compensation, and workplace experiences, I want to highlight how this demographic is
                disproportionally affected as compared to their white, heterosexual, and cisgender peers. Spotlighting
                the negative experiences and repercussions faced by the LGBTQ+ community, such as a lack of
                employment, reduced hiring and promotion rates, </p>

            <h2>Motivations Behind This Resource</h2>
            <p>As a gender-nonconforming person, I am acutely aware of my identity and often feel compelled to conceal
                this facet of myself at work. My fears of jeopardizing career opportunities are
                compounded by the need to navigate workplace dynamics carefully, often placating colleagues to avoid
                conflict. Additionally, as a person of color, I am deeply interested in exploring how the
                intersectionality of race, class, and gender identity further shapes the experiences of LGBTQ+ and
                gender-nonconforming individuals in the workforce.

                Through this project, I aim to shed light on the various forms of discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ and
                gender-nonconforming people in the workplace. While landmark rulings such as <i>Bostock v. Clayton County</i>
                offer some legal protection, more subtle and systemic forms of bias persist and is not covered by
                legislation. By presenting this information, I hope to empower my peers to approach the job market
                with a better understanding of their rights, strategies for self-advocacy, and tools to navigate these
                challenges.

                I also want to examine how workplace discrimination affects other aspects of life for
                LGBTQ+ and gender-nonconforming individuals, including mental health, financial stability, and social
                relationships. This broader perspective will help contextualize the struggles faced by our community and
                provide a more comprehensive understanding of the societal barriers we encounter. My ultimate goal is to
                not only inform but also inspire action against unjust treatment in professional environments, fostering
                workplaces that are truly inclusive and equitable for all. </p>
