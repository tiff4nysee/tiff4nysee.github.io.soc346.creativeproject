                    <h3>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</h3>
                <p> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from discrimination based on race,
                    color, religion, sex, or national origin. In a landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified
                    in <i>Bostock v. Clayton County</i> (2020) that these protections extend to LGBTQ+ individuals,
                    interpreting "sex" to include sexual orientation and gender identity. This means employers cannot
                    fire, refuse to hire, or treat individuals unfairly because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual,
                    transgender, or non-binary. Under Title VII, LGBTQ+ employees are shielded from bias in hiring and
                    termination, workplace harassment, unequal treatment in promotions or pay, and retaliation for reporting discrimination.
                    The law is further enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigates
                    complaints and can secure remedies such as back pay, reinstatement, or damages. Additionally, many
                    states and local jurisdictions offer broader protections, complementing Title VIIâ€™s federal
                    safeguards. Together, these legal frameworks ensure equal workplace rights for LGBTQ+ individuals.
