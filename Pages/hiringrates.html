            <h2>Hiring Rates</h2>
            <p>How are the hiring rates of LGBTQ+ and gender-nonconforming people in comparison to their heterosexual
                and cisgender peers? Using the insights that were gathered from a research conducted on a pool of
                non-binary people and hiring
                managers, here are the research questions and statistics. </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2 class="card-title">To what extent do you feel that identifying yourself as non-binary to a potential
                    employer would affect your job search?</h5>
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p class="card-text">Most participants in the research believed identifying as non-binary could
                            harm their job prospects, leading many to hide their identities to maintain employment. A
                            34-year-old worker in Florida shared, “I am in the non-binary closet due to professional
                            reasons… coming out could cost me future job opportunities.” However, some saw disclosing
                            their non-binary identity as a way to find inclusive employers. A 20-year-old student said,
                            “I include my pronouns early to gauge potential employers’
                            reactions.” </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2 class="card-title">In your opinion, how has your non-binary identity affected your work experience
                    in general?</h5>
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p class="card-text"> More than half of non-binary workers reported negative experiences in the
                            workplace, with those in the South feeling this more acutely due to the region’s
                            conservative values and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. A 25-year-old professional shared, “In
                            South Carolina, I was told I had to stay closeted to succeed,” contrasting with a better
                            experience in New York City. Forty-one percent of non-binary workers said their identity had
                            a neutral effect on their
                            careers, likely because many conceal their gender identity to avoid bias or violence.
                            A young worker in Oregon explained, “I hesitate to openly identify as non-binary… it
                            jeopardizes my safety.” Negative experiences also varied by assigned sex and other
                            intersecting identities.
                            Non-binary workers assigned female at birth reported more challenges than those assigned
                            male, facing compounded discrimination, particularly among workers of color and those with
                            disabilities. </p>

                <h2 class="card-title"> Study of Hiring Managers Confirms Bias Against Non-binary Job Seekers
                    </h5>
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p class="card-text"> The resume experiment showed that employers favored applicants who did not
                            disclose their gender identity. To explore why, the research surveyed 850 hiring managers,
                            showing them resumes with or without pronouns. Resumes with “they/them” pronouns received
                            less
                            favorable impressions, with 72% of managers willing to interview candidates without pronouns
                            compared to 69% for those with pronouns. Some hiring managers revealed blatant bias, citing
                            pronouns as a reason to reject resumes.
                            Comments included phrases like, “Take off the pronouns; I would trash the resume,” and “The
                            pronouns are off-putting and unnecessary.” Such bias was present across industries,
                            including progressive fields like education and entertainment, and in liberal regions.
                            Managers also spent less time reviewing resumes with pronouns, suggesting quicker decisions
                            against these candidates, even when overt bias wasn’t expressed. </p>
